            The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the best-known combinatorial optimization problems. Many methods derived from TSP have been applied to study autonomous vehicle route planning with fuel constraints. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to reinforcement learning (RL) as a potential method to solve refueling problems. This paper employs RL to solve the traveling salesman problem With refueling (TSPWR). The technique proposes a model (actions, states, reinforcements) and RL-TSPWR algorithm. Focus is given on the analysis of RL parameters and on the refueling influence in route learning optimization of fuel cost. Two RL algorithms: Q-learning and SARSA are compared. In addition, RL parameter estimation is performed by Response Surface Methodology, Analysis of Variance and Tukey Test. The proposed method achieves the best solution in 15 out of 16 case studies.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyze an optimization problem that arises in the overhaul of a gas turbine engine. This problem involves the placement of nozzle guide vanes in the nozzle of the engine. The objective of the vane placement is to attain "uniform" flow (equalized distribution of hot fuel gases) about the circumference of the engine nozzle. We show that this placement problem is equivalent to a traveling salesman problem (TSP) whose cost matrix is a product matrix. Exploiting properties of the special form of the cost matrix, we give a heuristic algorithm for solving the problem, and derive a posteriori lower bounds for the heuristic. We show that the heuristic performs extremely well on both real and simulated data. Finally, we present and develop the theoretical results that are the foundation of the proposed heuristic.},

Eventually, a subset is found that contains a single tour whose length is less than or equal to some lower bound for every tour. The motivation of the branching and the calculation of the lower bounds are based on ideas frequently used in solving assignment problems. Computationally, the algorithm extends the size of problem that can reasonably be solved without using methods special to the particular problem.},
